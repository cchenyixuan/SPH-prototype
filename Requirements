f(geometry) -> discrete geometry of particles

f(domain, geometry) -> hash table of all particles inside discrete domain

f(domain, geometry, hash_table) -> solver iterate step by step

require validation check for acceleration/ velocity/ movement in compute shaders and apply auto-adapt-time-step integrator

voxel compute shader and compute4 solver could not be used at same time due to buffer memory access conflict

New inspect! Voxel orientation NOT MATCH!! Urgent fix is required!

Voxel Phase Interface Error, require fixing!
